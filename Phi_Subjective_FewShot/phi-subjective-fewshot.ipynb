The excess amino acids form crystals that can accumulate in the kidneys, bladder, and ureters. These crystals can cause recurrent kidney stones and urinary tract infections. \\n\\nCystinuria is caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins that transport amino acids in the kidneys and the intestines. The most common genes involved are SLC3A1 and SLC7A9. Mutations in these genes result in a defect in the transport of cystine and other dibasic amino acids in the kidneys and intestines. This leads to an increased concentration of these amino acids in the urine, which causes the formation of cystine', 'Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare and life-threatening syndrome of excessive immune activation.

When the kidneys are not working well, waste products can build up in the blood. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. Anemia is a common complication of CKD. It occurs when the kidneys do not produce enough of a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO). EPO is important for the production of red blood cells. When there is not enough EPO, the body cannot produce enough red blood cells. This leads to anemia.

PVNS causes the synovial membrane to become thickened and inflamed, leading to pain, swelling, and stiffness in the affected joint. \\n\\nDiagnosing PVNS can be challenging because the symptoms are similar to other joint conditions, such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. However, there are several tests that can help diagnose PVNS:\\n\\n1. Physical examination: A doctor will perform a physical examination to check for signs of joint inflammation, such as swelling, redness, and warmth.\\n\\n2', 'Marinesco-Sjgren syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and the exocrine glands. The exocrine glands are responsible for producing fluids that lubricate the eyes, mouth, and digestive system.

The heart's electrical system normally controls the rate and timing of heartbeats. In LQTS, the heart's electrical system is abnormal, causing the heart to beat irregularly. This can cause the heart to beat very fast, or flutter. The heart may also stop beating for a short time (arrhythmia). \\n\\nLong QT syndrome is a genetic condition that can be passed down through families. It is caused by changes (mutations) in genes that control the heart's electrical system. These genes are called ion channel genes.

This region contains many genes that are important for normal brain development. The deletion of this region can cause a variety of problems, including intellectual disability, autism, and epilepsy. The deletion is usually not inherited from a parent. Instead, it occurs during the formation of the egg or sperm. This is called a de novo mutation. However, in some cases, a parent may carry a small piece of the deleted region on one of their chromosomes. This is called a balanced translocation. In this case, the parent may not have any symptoms of the deletion syndrome, but they can pass the translocation on to their children.', 'The following are some of the treatments for glycogen storage disease type V:  - Dietary therapy  - Exercise therapy  - Pharmacological therapy  - Liver transplantation  - Gene therapy  - Enzyme replacement therapy', 'Emanuel syndrome is a rare chromosomal disorder that affects males.

Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that carry signals between nerve cells. Mutations in the SPTBP gene disrupt the normal function of spatacsin, leading to a decrease in choline transport into cells. This impairs the formation and maintenance of cell membranes and neurotransmitters, which affects the normal function of the nervous system.

The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.

The FXN gene provides instructions for making a protein called frataxin. Frataxin is found in the mitochondria, the energy-producing centers of cells. The frataxin protein is believed to be involved in the formation of energy-producing molecules called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The FXN gene mutation causes the frataxin protein to be absent or present in insufficient amounts. The lack of frataxin leads to the accumulation of iron in the mitochondria. The excess iron damages the mitochondria, which leads to the death of nerve cells in the spinal cord and the nerves that connect the spinal cord to the muscles. The damage to these nerves causes the movement problems characteristic of Friedreich ataxia.', 'Yes, Best vitelliform macular dystrophy is inherited.

This condition is caused by changes in the BRCA1 gene.  The BRCA1 gene is a tumor suppressor gene. Tumor suppressor genes are genes that help control cell growth.  When tumor suppressor genes do not work properly, cells can grow and divide in an uncontrolled way, which can lead to cancer.  BRCA1 hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition. This means that a change in just one copy of the BRCA1 gene in each cell is enough to increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer.

Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease is an inherited disease that causes progressive brain damage and dementia. It is caused by mutations in the MJD1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the transport of molecules within cells. The protein is thought to be involved in the transport of molecules that are important for the normal functioning of brain cells. Mutations in the MJD1 gene lead to the production of an abnormal protein that cannot be transported properly within brain cells. This disrupts the transport of molecules that are important for brain cell function. The disruption of brain cell function leads to the progressive brain damage and dementia that are characteristic of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease.', 'Megalocytic interstitial nephritis is a rare kidney disorder characterized by the presence of large kidney cells (megalocytes) in the interstitial tissue of the kidney.
